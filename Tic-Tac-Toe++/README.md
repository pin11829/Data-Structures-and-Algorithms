# Tic-Tac-Toe++


## The rules of this game are a bit different from normal tic-tac-toe.

	1. 5x5 board

	2. Every round, the player whose turn it is must place down two pieces

	3. Player O goes first

	4. After round 11, the game is finished (board filled)


## How to determine win or loss

	1. First, fill the last three empty spaces with Xâ€™s

	2. If there are four pieces (out of 5 spaces, and not necessarily consecutive) of the same type forming a line (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical), this will count as a point for that player.

	3. Whoever has the most points wins. If both players have the same number of points, then it counts as a tie.
